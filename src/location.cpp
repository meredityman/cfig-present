The city of Hamburg is <br>doing an okay job to adapt to the altered temperature. The plants we see are imported plants, coming from areas where the <br>nowadays temperature is as high as by 2050. The buildings are packed with solar-panels, the glass surface maybe darkended, <br>AC’s are installed. The sky is blue, no clouds to see.<br>Cyane might be near the water, but almost not visible.", "2050", "", "", ""),
    Location("2-Stairs", "The Stairs", "53.539900, 10.002647", "<br>FLOODED<br>The extreme weather conditions that happen on a daily base s are outdone by a recent one – heavy rain and strong winds have <br>led to a massive flooding. The preparations for such an event have underestimated the force of the hurricane. The buildings are <br>shattered by the winds, the floor covered by mould, as it might have rained for several weeks – and a heavy rainfall paired with a <br>dried out floor has led to huge amounts of water, that might have flooded the whole city. But the Hafencity, already today a <br>„Hochwasser-Risikogebiet“, was affected immensly by the flooding. The Sky is grey. No ships to see, and if, they are strongly <br>affected by the flood.<br>Cyane seems to be thriving and benefitting of the lesser activity of humans.", "2060", "", "", ""),
    Location("3-Playground", "The Playground", "53.540538, 10.002488", "<br>REOCCUPATION OF THE AREA<br>The shattered buildings are used in a different way: While today the Hafencity Gmbh builds a surrounding that is designed for the <br>wealthy percentages of the society and offers a prestigious location for offices, the area has been a waste-area for some time – <br>it seems that Cyane spread out in a fast growing track and inhabited the area. As the city department does so far not know how<br> to react to this unknown species they focused the reparations of the damages of the flooding – and the security measurements<br> for yet to come floods – to other areas of the city. Due to the climate crises, where western and north European countries still <br>offer a liveable surrounding, big numbers of refugees live in Hamburg. The Hafencity is kind of occupied by them, as there seems<br> to be not enough capacity in the provided housing. We see self constructed / Slum-like buildings, as usual the most vulnerable<br> ones are in the area with the most density of Cyane. ", "2070", "", "", ""),
    Location("4-Subway", "The Subway", "53.540656, 10.006829", "<br>NO MORE SHADOW / BUNKER<br>The Subway is transformed to be a bunker / camp – the entries are blocked with massive doors, to keep Cyane out, but also to <br>keep the heat out. All the buildings with underground structures are transformed into living areas. The subway is only one example<br> for this, as the soil provides a lesser high temperature. Supposedly the Bunker-Situation helps as well with supposed attacks of <br>any kind. <br>The underground-people fight against Cyane, it seems to be a Cyane free area – but maybe there still is some now and then.", "2080", "", "", ""),

Strange plants grow in the park, Cyane itself might <br>have transformed, reshaped, it is extremely hot. Dependent on your viewpoint this is an utopian or dystopian setting. There seems <br>to be a shimmer covering everything (Images of the movie Annihilation come to mind). Everything is very colourful.", "2090", "", "", ""),
