ADAPTION
The Temperature has risen. Even though we rarely see rain, the level of the Elbe is higher than nowadays. The city of Hamburg is 
doing an okay job to adapt to the altered temperature. The plants we see are imported plants, coming from areas where the 
nowadays temperature is as high as by 2050. The buildings are packed with solar-panels, the glass surface maybe darkended, 
AC’s are installed. The sky is blue, no clouds to see.
Cyane might be near the water, but almost not visible.",2050,,,

FLOODED
The extreme weather conditions that happen on a daily base s are outdone by a recent one – heavy rain and strong winds have 
led to a massive flooding. The preparations for such an event have underestimated the force of the hurricane. The buildings are 
shattered by the winds, the floor covered by mould, as it might have rained for several weeks – and a heavy rainfall paired with a 
dried out floor has led to huge amounts of water, that might have flooded the whole city. But the Hafencity, already today a 
„Hochwasser-Risikogebiet“, was affected immensly by the flooding. The Sky is grey. No ships to see, and if, they are strongly 
affected by the flood.
Cyane seems to be thriving and benefitting of the lesser activity of humans.",2060,,,

REOCCUPATION OF THE AREA
The shattered buildings are used in a different way: While today the Hafencity Gmbh builds a surrounding that is designed for the 
wealthy percentages of the society and offers a prestigious location for offices, the area has been a waste-area for some time – 
it seems that Cyane spread out in a fast growing track and inhabited the area. As the city department does so far not know how
 to react to this unknown species they focused the reparations of the damages of the flooding – and the security measurements
 for yet to come floods – to other areas of the city. Due to the climate crises, where western and north European countries still 
offer a liveable surrounding, big numbers of refugees live in Hamburg. The Hafencity is kind of occupied by them, as there seems
 to be not enough capacity in the provided housing. We see self constructed / Slum-like buildings, as usual the most vulnerable
 ones are in the area with the most density of Cyane. ",2070,,,

NO MORE SHADOW / BUNKER
The Subway is transformed to be a bunker / camp – the entries are blocked with massive doors, to keep Cyane out, but also to 
keep the heat out. All the buildings with underground structures are transformed into living areas. The subway is only one example
 for this, as the soil provides a lesser high temperature. Supposedly the Bunker-Situation helps as well with supposed attacks of 
any kind. 
The underground-people fight against Cyane, it seems to be a Cyane free area – but maybe there still is some now and then.",2080,,,

COHABITANTS
It seems that humankind and Cyane have found a way to cohabit the space. Strange plants grow in the park, Cyane itself might 
have transformed, reshaped, it is extremely hot. Dependent on your viewpoint this is an utopian or dystopian setting. There seems 
to be a shimmer covering everything (Images of the movie Annihilation come to mind). Everything is very colourful.",2090,,,
